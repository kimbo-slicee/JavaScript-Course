* - The DOM, or Document Object Model, refers to the representation of a web page as a structured object. When a web
*  page loads, the browser creates a model of the page in the form of an object that includes all its elements. This
*  allows developers to interact with and manipulate these elements programmatically using languages like
*  JavaScript. read the Read me for more Info

//log window the Global object
console.log(window)
// show Document Structure Object
console.log(document);// object contain all our page elements
console.log(document.body)// body <body>...</body> in my web page
console.log(document.title)// DOM Elements
console.log(document.links);//[link1,link2]
console.log(document.links[0].href);//https://www.google.com/
// so withe the DOM we can Interact with All Page Elements and we can Also use selectors to target specific elements
