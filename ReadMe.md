# JavaScript Course Repository

### Purposes of Creating This Course
Hello JavaScript Student!
As we know, JavaScript is a vast language, and it can be challenging to remember all its functions, classes, and concepts. To help with this, I decided to create this repository to collect everything I know about JavaScript in one place. This course includes explanations, practical assignments, and notes designed to make learning JavaScript more efficient and enjoyable.
