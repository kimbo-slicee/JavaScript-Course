// Assignment Operator in JavaScript
// The = Operator
// The Simple Assignment Operator assigns a value to a variable .
let x=10;
let y=1.2;
let z;
// if we want to increment x withe 5;
x=x+5;// there is another syntax really ??
console.log(x)// 20
// Yea there is another syntax like :
console.log(x+=5);//20 ; but if we revers it like x=+5 what is the output let's say
console.log(x=+5)// 5
//My question is how to swap them but i want the value of b=2 and the value of a=2 you can use z
let a = 1,
    b = 2;
